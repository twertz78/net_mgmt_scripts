# net_mgmt_scripts 
net_mgmt_scripts is a basic repository for my simple management tasks to manage the network at ISU. 
To get started, you will need to navigate to net_mgmt_scripts/venv/ and run the "get_secrets.py" script. Follow the on screen prompts.
This will allow you to use most of the other files.
